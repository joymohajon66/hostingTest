    	<h1>Characteristics</h1>
    	<p>A computer is a machine that uses electronics to input, process, and then output data. Input of data means to read data from a keyboard, a storage device like a hard drive, or from a sensor. The data is processed or changed using software programs. The data is then sent out to a storage device or screen or to another computer. Computers can be connected together to form networks, allowing connected computers to communicate with each other. Computers can come in different shapes and sizes, depending on the brand and model and purpose.</p>
    	<p>The two important parts of a computer are: It responds to a specific instruction set in a well-defined manner and it can execute a stored list of instructions call a program. There are four main actions in a computer: inputting, storing, outputting and processing.</p>


<p>
Modern computers can do billions of calculations in a second. Being able to calculate many times per second allows modern computers to multi-task, which means they can do many different tasks at the same time. Computers do many different jobs where automation is useful. Some examples are controlling traffic lights, vehicle , security systems, washing machines and digital televisions.</p>
<P>
Computers can be designed to do almost anything with information. Computers are used to control large and small machines which in the past were controlled by humans. Most people have used a personal computer in their home or at work. They are used for things such as calculation, listening to music, reading an article, writing etc.</P>

    	<h1>The computing era</h1>
<p>At the end of the Middle Ages, people started thinking math and engineering were more important. In 1623, Wilhelm Schickard made a mechanical calculator. Other Europeans made more calculators after him. They were not modern computers because they could only add, subtract, and multiply- you could not change what they did to make them do something like play Tetris. Because of this, we say they were not programmable. Now engineers use computers to design and plan.</p>

<P>In 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard used punched paper cards to tell his textile loom what kind of pattern to weave. He could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do, and he could change the punch cards, which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted. This means the loom was programmable. At the end of the 1800s Herman Hollerith invented the recording of data on a medium that could then be read by a machine, developing punched card data processing technology for the 1890 U.S. census. His tabulating machines read and summarized data stored on punched cards and they began use for government and commercial data processing.</P>
